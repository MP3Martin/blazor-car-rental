# Basic info

This website uses Blazor WASM for the frontend and there is no backend.
It is a single-page app, so you don't have to wait when switching between pages.
The application is admin-pov only.

# Pages

## Main page (cars)

### Structure

When you open the site, the main page opens automatically. There you can see cars in this format:

### Creating and editing

There is a purple "Add a car" button that show a dialog where you can edit all the info about the new car. That same
dialog is used for editing cars.

If you are on a pc, you can move your cursor over the individual cars and an edit button will appear to edit them. The
edit buttons are always visible on touch devices.

## Customers page

This page is only for managing customers. You can also use this page to quickly se all the cars that are rented to a
specific customer.

## Settings

The settings are stored in a different Local storage field, but the exported JSON contains
both [Customers and Settings](../blazor-car-rental/Classes/SaveData.cs). Settings are automatically saved, but not
immediately. The actual settings
saving [is debounced](https://github.com/MP3Martin/blazor-car-rental/blob/main/blazor-car-rental%2FPages%2FSettings.razor#L78-L97) ([explanation here](https://medium.com/@jamischarles/what-is-debouncing-2505c0648ff1))
and triggers on any setting change.

# Storing data

All data is serialized using [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) and stored
in [Local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage#description).
All data can also be exported and imported as JSON.
While running, all the variables are stored in [a service](../blazor-car-rental/Services/StateService.cs).
